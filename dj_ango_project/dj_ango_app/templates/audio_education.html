                <div>Merit <br> <br> Conversion course in computing science for students from other disciplines including modules in: <br> <br> - Advanced programming <br> - Software engineering practices <br> - Algorithms and data structures <br> - Database theory and applications <br> - Enterprise cyber security <br> - Systems and networks <br> - Human computer interaction <br> - Information visualisation <br> <br> I also began development of the web app <a href="https://soundotwo.vercel.app" target="_blank">Soundo</a> as my dissertation project which allows users to experiment with working audio effects components on audio samples which are hosted within a web browser in real time. This is done using the React framework in Typescript, making use of the Tone.js library. This was initially developed during a 12 week time frame but has seen continuous development since then.
